                <p>
                    <i>The Beth Qaṭraye Gazetteer</i> is one of the publications of the Beth Qaṭraye
                    Project a research project funded by NPRP grant NPRP9-002-6-001 from the <a href="https://www.qnrf.org/">Qatar National Research Fund</a> (a member of
                    <a href="https://www.qf.org.qa/">The Qatar Foundation</a>). The LPI of the
                    project is Dr. Haya Al Thani (Qatar University). The statements made herein are
                    solely the responsibility of the authors.</p>
                <h2>Formal Project Title</h2>
                <p>A preliminary Syriac, Aramaic and Arabic lexical and toponymical survey of Beth
                    Qaṭraye based on historical, archaeological and lexicographical evidence.</p>
                <h2>About Beth Qaṭraye</h2>
                <p>Beth Qaṭraye, Syriac for “region of the Qataris”, is a term found in Syriac
                    literature referring to the region of North-East Arabia including Qatar and
                    Bahrain from the fourth to the ninth centuries. Beth Qaṭraye was an important
                    cultural, linguistic and religious crossroads in the pre-Islamic and early
                    Islamic period, when it produced one of the most widely translated Syriac
                    authors of all time (Isaac of Nineveh, called after his bishopric, who is also
                    known as Isaac Qaṭraya or “the Qatari”). A number of other important Syriac
                    authors also came from Beth Qaṭraye in this period in which the Syriac community
                    there was not only surviving but producing some of the finest and most educated
                    authors of the time, many of whom became intellectual, spiritual or religious
                    leaders in the Middle East as a whole.</p>
                <h2>Beth Qaṭraye Project Objectives</h2>
                <p>This project has two objectives. The results of the first objective are published
                    here as <i>The Beth Qaṭraye Gazetteer</i> here. The results of the second
                    objective will be published through <a href="www.bethmardutho.org/">Beth
                        Mardutho: The Syriac Institute</a>.</p>
                <p>The first objective of this research project is to collect and analyze
                    information on the pre-Islamic and early Islamic historical geography and
                    toponyms of the Beth Qaṭraye region from the most important available sources as
                    well as later toponymical studies. The toponyms will shed light on the language
                    of Beth Qaṭraye in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period by analyzing their
                    Syriac, Aramaic and Arabic etymology and name components. The historical and
                    archaeological geography will clarify the cultural relations between this region
                    and other areas around the Gulf, and how patterns of social predominance shifted
                    over time. This will provide a better understanding of not only the dynamics of
                    society within Beth Qaṭraye, but also the place of Beth Qaṭraye within the
                    larger history of the Middle East in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods.
                    The data collected in this part of the Beth Qaṭraye Project is published in
                    collaboration with <a href="http://syriaca.org">Syriaca.org</a> as <i>The Beth
                        Qaṭraye Gazetteer</i>, a part of <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i>.</p>
                <p>A second objective of this project is to determine the set of lexemes that are
                    designated in the Syriac/Arabic lexicon of Bar Bahlul and other Syriac texts
                    such as the Synodicon Orientale and the East-Syriac Anonymous Commentary as
                    belonging to the dialect of Beth Qaṭraye. This will shed important light on the
                    languages and dialects that were in use in the Arabian Peninsula not only in the
                    pre-Islamic period, but also what has survived there in the post-Islamic period
                    since Ibn Bahlul, for example, belongs to the tenth century. This portion of the
                    project will produce a number of publications including a toponymical and a
                    lexical dictionary in addition to an online lexical search tool published
                    through <a href="www.bethmardutho.org/">Beth Mardutho: The Syriac
                        Institute</a>.</p>
