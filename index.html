                <p>Beth Qaṭraye, Syriac for “region of the Qataris”, is a term found in Syriac
                    literature referring to the region of North-East Arabia including Qatar and
                    Bahrain from the fourth to the ninth centuries. Beth Qaṭraye was an important
                    cultural, linguistic and religious crossroads in the pre- Islamic and early
                    Islamic period, when it produced one of the most widely translated Syriac
                    authors of all time (Isaac of Nineveh, called after his bishopric, who is also
                    known as Isaac Qaṭraya or “the Qatari”). A number of other important Syriac
                    authors also came from Beth Qaṭraye in this period, and scholarship has so far
                    only focused on these Syriac authors and their writings rather than other
                    aspects of Beth Qaṭraye. The objective of <em>The Beth Qaṭraye Gazetteer</em> is
                    to collect and analyze information on the pre-Islamic and early Islamic
                    historical geography and toponyms of the Beth Qaṭraye region. </p>
